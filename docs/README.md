## Creating Better Documentation with LLMs: Lessons Learned from Working with Claude

I had collaborated with Claude on creating this guide. This project yielded valuable insights into the process of creating documentation with Large Language Models (LLMs).

### An Unexpected Discovery: LLM Characteristics and Challenges

This guide creation project actually had two objectives. The first was to create a useful guide, and the second was to explore methods for creating better documentation with Claude. As we progressed, we discovered some interesting characteristics of LLMs.

One particularly notable observation was the LLM's tendency to constantly suggest improvements. When evaluating whether the guide's content was sufficient for its purpose, Claude consistently proposed various enhancements. While this might seem beneficial at first glance, it actually made it difficult to determine when the content was "good enough."

### Finding a Solution: Applying Software Development Methodologies

This challenge led us to an interesting approach: applying requirements definition methods commonly used in software development to document creation. We found that establishing clear requirements specifications before starting the documentation could potentially offer several benefits:

- Establishing clear evaluation criteria
- Defining sufficient scope
- Setting objective quality indicators

When we actually created the requirements specification, we were able to derive necessary requirements from the original purpose without being influenced by the existing guide content. This allowed for a more objective evaluation of the guide's content.

### Additional Insights from Documentation with LLMs

The project revealed several other interesting findings.

#### Prevalent Use of Bullet Points

We noticed that Claude tended to favor bullet points over extended prose. While this might reflect the influence of English technical documentation style, it's worth considering whether this approach is always optimal, particularly when the goal is to present complex ideas that might benefit from more narrative exposition.

#### LLM Self-Awareness

Another interesting discovery was that LLMs might not fully grasp the extent of their own capabilities. Our experience suggests that building mutual understanding through dialogue and exploring capabilities through trial and error may be more important than relying on the LLM's self-reported abilities.

### Moving Forward with Documentation

These insights offer valuable guidance for creating documentation with LLMs. Several key points emerge:

1. Pre-defined Requirements
   Starting with clear requirements specifications can help focus the document creation process.

2. Conscious Style Choices
   Consider the balance between narrative prose and structured lists based on the document's purpose and content.

3. Continuous Dialogue and Adjustment
   Maintain ongoing communication with the LLM to deepen mutual understanding and improve outcomes.

### Remaining Challenges: Limitations of the Requirements Approach

While creating requirements specifications appears to be a promising approach to documentation, our trials revealed new challenges. When evaluating against requirements, the LLM sometimes interpreted the specifications broadly, leading to proposals for extensive revisions. This suggests that controlling the scope through requirements specifications alone has its limitations.

Several areas need further exploration and refinement:

- Improving requirements specification methods
- Establishing incremental revision processes
- Developing explicit ways to limit the scope of changes

### Conclusion

While LLMs can be powerful collaborators in document creation, understanding their characteristics and learning to work with them effectively is crucial. Our experience has provided valuable insights into effective collaboration with LLMs, while also highlighting areas that need further development.

We hope these insights and awareness of the challenges will help readers in their own documentation projects with LLMs.
