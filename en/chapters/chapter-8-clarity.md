   - References need explanation
   - Context needs to be clear

### What This Means for Our Work

1. Planning Sessions

   - Set clear goals
   - Share needed context
   - Provide complete information
   - Define purpose

2. Managing Information

   - Organize your points
   - Structure logically
   - Reference clearly
   - Give full context

## Clear Communication Structure

   ```

2. Setting Context

## Handling Complex Topics

### Breaking Down Big Goals

   Then we can tackle each one systematically."
   ```

2. Step-by-Step Progress

   ```
   "For each part, I'll help you:

   3. Develop solutions

   ```

## Getting Better Answers

### Clear Questions

   ```
   "That helps, but let's:
   - Focus more on [specific aspect]
